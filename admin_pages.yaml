# admin_pages.yaml defines the admin pages - beware that strings in here are not marked for translation so some work needs to be done to get that to work - hopefully an in-wordpress translation plugin 

# although this page will be automatically created when the settings are defined it is easier to manage the order it is displayed in if we define it here
settings:
  type: settings
